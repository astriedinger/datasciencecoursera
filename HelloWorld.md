#Hi Everyone !!

If you are reading this file in the summer of 2014, then you are most likely another student like myself in the online course of [Data Scientist’s toolbox][1] from the [Johns Hopkins University] [2], provided by their [Bloomberg School of Public Health] [3]. If you are not a fellow student, you can still find this information useful if possible.

##This is a markdown file

As other students, I have made this [Markdown] [5] document with a [live editor] [6]. Hence all the text that you see here was made using markdown syntax; in my VIM editor I had to make it recognize the syntax =/. But to download markdown editor on your computer visit this [download site] [7]. For learning purposes you can also [fork][8] the [Markdown Cheatsheet] [9] from *Adam Pritchard*. In this way you also experiment with **GitHub**. Please read his instructions carefully as his content is also public. *- I have forked it for me already*.

In addition you can also play with markdown on your [emails !][10], *Pritchard* also has it on its **GitHub repo**.... any guess where the link is  ? =). Hint: *I am cheating !* .... 

In case you wounder by now why I assumed you were a student from the [Data Scientist’s toolbox][11] online course,  let me just explain it to you. One of the course assignments was to make a *sample markdown document* like this one, set the heading "This is a markdown file", *push* it to **GitHub**, and allow others to evaluate it. If you read some of the material I have already provided you in the links above you should know what the code behind this heading is. *Don’t mind the {}.*

#Other Online CourseWares 

In addition to **COURSERA**, some of you may know about **[edx][12]**, a similar initiative by many universities. You can also check the **[MIT OCW][13]** which in my perspective was one of the first *[OpenCourseWares][14]* ever to exist and hosts a wide variety of contents, video lectures, pdfs and more. For me it all started there =). Other universities have joined this **OCW** effort during the years and the consortium **[OCWC][15]** was born: *The Global Network for Open Education*. From there on you can branch to other university sites which may are not yet be in **edx** or **COURSERA**. If you find more sites that don’t branch from the previous, please share !

#About me

I am a recent graduate in [Sustainable Energy Technology][25] from the **[TU Eindhoven][26]**, and a proud **Colombian** from Barranquilla, otherwise known as **[curramba][27]**!. I did my Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering at **[Univerisidad del Norte][28]**, and **MIT OCW** was a great help, so that is why I recommend it. You can keep in touch with me on [LinkedIN][29] or [@astriedinger][30].
